# [<sub>![Figma icon](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/32/figma.png)</sub>](https://figma.com/) Figma Plugin Template

This is a very minimal template for creating  Figma plugins. It uses Typescript and Rollup. For now, UI features are not included.

Use `npm run watch` to launch build process in watch mode, and use `npm run build` to build the plugin and pack it into an archive.
